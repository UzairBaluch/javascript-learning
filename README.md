# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey

**30 Projects in 30 Days Challenge**  
*From Retail Manager to Software Developer*

---

## 👋 About Me

I'm Uzair, a retail manager from Pakistan working in Oman, teaching myself to code while working 14-hour days. This repository documents my journey from complete beginner to building real-world JavaScript applications.

**Goal:** Transition from $300/month retail job to $1,000-1,500/month tech career by August 2026.

**Learning Philosophy:**
- ✅ Build projects, don't just watch tutorials
- ✅ Write every line of code myself
- ✅ Learn by doing, not by copying
- ✅ Embrace the struggle (that's where growth happens)

## 💡 Philosophy

*"I'm not just learning to code. I'm building a different future. Every line of code I write at midnight after 14 hours of retail work is proof that education level doesn't define potential. I will escape this $300/month job. I will teach coding in Pakistan. I will prove that a 7th grade dropout can become a developer."*
